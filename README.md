# Tobacco Mortality Prediction and Analysis
This project focuses on predicting tobacco-related mortality using advanced machine learning models and analyzing associated data. The solution includes models for **classification and time-series prediction (LSTM)** to provide accurate insights into tobacco-related health impacts.

## Overview
The project aims to provide insights into tobacco mortality rates through:

**Data Analysis:** Visualizing trends and patterns.

**Modeling:** Predicting tobacco-related mortality using machine learning techniques.

**Deployment:** Streamlit-based interactive web application for real-time prediction.

## Project Features
**Classification Model:** Classifies mortality based on tobacco usage data.

**LSTM Model:** Predicts mortality rates over time using historical data.

**Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit app to input data and visualize predictions.

**Data Visualization:** Trends, patterns, and insights visualized using graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python

**Frameworks/Libraries:**

-TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM Model)

-Scikit-learn (Classification Model)

-Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

-Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

**Deployment:**
-Streamlit (Web Interface)

-DagsHub (Version Control for Data/Models)

**Version Control:** Git/GitHub


## Model Deployment
